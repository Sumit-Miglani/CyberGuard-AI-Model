# CyberGuard-AI-Model
Repo for : India AI CyberGuard Hackathon 
Cybercrime is a rapidly evolving threat, impacting individuals and organizations worldwide. To combat this challenge, our project focuses on developing an AI-powered text classification system that categorizes cybercrime reports into actionable insights. Designed with precision and efficiency, the system leverages cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a pre-trained BERT model to classify reports into categories, subcategories, and overarching themes. This tool aims to empower law enforcement and NCRP by streamlining the analysis of unstructured textual data.

# Key features of the project include:
Automated Classification: The model predicts detailed subcategories like UPI Frauds, Cyberbullying, and Hacking, while mapping them to 3 main categories: Women/Child Related Crimes, Financial Fraud Crimes, and Other Cybercrimes with an accuracy of 83.18%.
Data-Driven Insights: Interactive visualizations, such as word clouds and trend charts, uncover commonly reported themes and emerging patterns.
User-Friendly Design: A professional, Tkinter-based UI makes it easy to input reports, view results, and export findings.
This system also addresses data imbalance issues using advanced techniques, ensuring balanced predictions for underrepresented categories like Ransomware and Cyber Terrorism.

Hence, The project is making a sustainable approach in making India head towards more organized Digital Complaint Registration and Resolution powered by AI.
